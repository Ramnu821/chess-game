♟️ Chess Game with AI using Python | Minimax + Alpha-Beta Pruning

This repository contains a fully functional Chess Game implemented in Python with an AI opponent powered by Minimax Algorithm and Alpha-Beta Pruning. The project demonstrates the use of DAA and AI concepts for decision-making and move optimization. The game uses Pygame to provide an interactive GUI.

🚀 Key Highlights

✅ Human vs AI Gameplay
✅ Minimax Algorithm for Move Prediction
✅ Alpha-Beta Pruning for Faster Decisions
✅ Heuristic Evaluation of Board States
✅ Clean OOP-based Code Structure
✅ Pygame-based Graphical Interface
